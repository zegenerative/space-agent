# Space Agent
## An IoT project that monitors and controls (bookings of) a space using Raspberry Pi, motion sensor and an LCD screen.

### What does the Space Agent do?
- is the space booked?
- are there people in the space? (how many = nice to have)
- if so, do nothing
- if not, cancel booking, so space can be booked again
